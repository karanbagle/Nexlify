# Nexlify
A dependency-aware load balancer that prevents microservices failures with real-time traffic routing.

## The Problem
Microservices depend on each other, and a single failure can cascade. Current load balancers donâ€™t adapt to dependency health in real-time.

## The Solution
Nexlify uses multithreaded processing and a dynamic dependency graph to route traffic intelligently, ensuring system reliability.

## Features
- Real-time dependency tracking
- Multithreaded health metrics
- Dynamic routing
- WebSocket dashboard

## Setup
[To be added after development]
